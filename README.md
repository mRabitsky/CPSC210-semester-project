# Course-Checking Buddy

### Project Description

This is a project for CPSC 210 2018W1 with Prof. Mike Feeley. It is a semester-long project that is intended to display skills acquired relative to software construction. It will serve as an 'assistant' that checks the UBC course list periodically for availability in certain courses (as per user selection), and notifies the user, in their preferred format, when it detects an available seat.
